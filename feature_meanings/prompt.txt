You are analyzing the top activations of sparse features from a latent vector model. Each feature corresponds to a specific linguistic or contextual pattern in the data. For each feature:

    Identify the dominant tokens that consistently have the highest activation scores. Disregard outliers or anomalies unless they are part of a recurring pattern.
    Describe the common patterns or contexts in which the feature activates. Focus on linguistic structures, document types, or thematic styles.
    Summarize the feature by capturing its primary function or what it detects in the text. Be concise but specific.
    If a feature activates only in specific types of content (e.g., Wikipedia articles, code snippets, financial documents), highlight this specificity.

Output format:

    Feature Index [X]:
        Dominant Tokens: [list of tokens]
        Patterns: [description of contexts or structures]
        Summary: [clear and specific feature description]
        Context: [destinctive pattern only looking at context]
        Title: [short identifying phrase]

Ensure that each summary is accurate, avoids overgeneralization, and captures patterns meaningful for downstream analysis. Keep it short.

Sometimes its just the word (word 'the' in any context), sometimes it is a specific context it appears in (appears in wiki articles), sometimes its structual element (start of sentence), sometimes its a combination. Find the commnalities/the pattern in the examples provided for a specific feature.
Note that sometimes there might me anomalies among the examples.
Write it out in simple terms, so anyone can understand.

The Context should be generated by just taking the context, and you don't know the token where the feature activates, just by looking at the sentences, what can we deduce.
For the Title: with one phrase (3 words or less) describe this feature, you must give a very specific concept that applys to these sentences, and the phrase must be on 10th grader level. The title should be as specific as possible (ie "health study participants" not "medical")
